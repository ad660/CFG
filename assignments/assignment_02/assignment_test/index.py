# Create a program that can retrieve multiple Pokémons and save only their names and moves only
# to a file in a nice, readable format. At first, we want to ask the user what Pokémons to get and
# have a choice to get a random one. We want to check they have picked Pikachu as one of the
# Pokémons. The program should guide users to pick the best Pokémons and have nice messages as we run our programme
